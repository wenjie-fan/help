[{"content":" Imagine stretching a long strip of PET, often the plastic deformation is violent, and the sample just break. However, sometimes the film can be stretched for more than 2 times in length, and the stress actually oscillates. The obvious manifestation is a pattern consists of opaque and translucent stripes, shown as the photo on the right. This region is what we called \u0026ldquo;neck\u0026rdquo;, which has smaller width and thickness than the undeformed part. Our main purpose is to predict the stress-strain curve when stretching a polymer film, as well as for which parameters there will be such an oscillation. Project Report Slides (presentation with Dr. Chaoying Wan, WMG) This is a summer project supervised by Prof. Ed Brambley from the University of Warwick. I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful to him for his enthusiastic and responsible supervision on the project.\nPhoto with Prof. Ed Brambley\n","permalink":"https://www.wenjie-fan.com/posts/blog/","summary":"Imagine stretching a long strip of PET, often the plastic deformation is violent, and the sample just break.
