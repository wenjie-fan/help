Imagine stretching a long strip of PET, often the plastic deformation is violent, and the sample just break. <br/> <br/>
However, sometimes the film can be stretched for more <br/> than 2 times in length, and the stress actually oscillates. <br/> The obvious manifestation is a pattern consists of opaque and translucent stripes, shown as the photo on the right. This region is what we called "neck", which has smaller <br/> width and thickness than the undeformed part. Our main purpose is to predict the stress-strain curve when <br/> stretching a polymer film, as well as for which parameters there will be such an oscillation.

This is a summer project supervised by [**Prof. Ed Brambley**](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/E.J.Brambley/) from the University of Warwick. I'm very grateful to him for his enthusiastic and responsible supervision on the project.
